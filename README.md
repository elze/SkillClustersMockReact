# SkillClusters with a React.js frontend


Rewriting the SkillClusters app with a React.js frontend as a React.js learning project.

This is the same app that was initially written with an Angular.js frontend, and is deployed at http://elze.pythonanywhere.com . We will aim the current app to look like that, minus the bugs.

This app is currently deployed at http://skillclusters-react.herokuapp.com .
